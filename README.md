# Pintos
[Pintos](http://pintos-os.org) is a teaching operating system for x86. The main source code, documentation and assignments 
are developed by Ben Pfaff and others from Stanford (refer to its [LICENSE](src/LICENSE)).

This version of PintOS is obtained from ([Ryan Huang](mailto:huang@cs.jhu.edu)) as instructed by the installation guidelines provided by UoM.
The upstream for this branch comes from [https://github.com/ryanphuang/PintosM](https://github.com/ryanphuang/PintosM).

This repository is maintained by me to keep track of the changes that I make to the PintOS source code on my local machine.
Running this required installing Linux, which was done using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL 2), with Ubuntu 22.0.4.
Good luck, and Godspeed!
